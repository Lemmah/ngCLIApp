# My First CLI App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/ngCLIApp.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd ngCLIApp`
- Install packages by running `npm install`. Wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.12.0 and above.
- Npm for package management, this comes with node.
Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to v8.12.0, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

All packages are installed by `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
